    <h1 id="h1"><strong>Iowa State Campus</strong></h1>
        <p id="p1">Since 2015, I have attended Iowa State University. Within the last year, I have become extremely interested in <em>Cartography</em> and <em>Geographic Information Systems</em>. I have many peers and professors who I would like to thank for their support in me in the beginning of my career in natural resourse management. Working on the <a id="firstLink"; href="https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/research/STRIPS/" title="STRIPS" color="green" target="blank">STRIPS</a> team has forever influenced how I approach conservation and our precious natural areas.

        <p id="p1">Above is an image of Iowa State's campus. This is an area I am very familiar with and will always be priceless to look at. Directly below is an image of Beardshear Hall. A staple of ISU, you can&rsquo;t miss it. Below that is a slippery map of ISU. This map allows you to zoom in and out.</p>
