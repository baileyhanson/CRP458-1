<h1 id="h1"><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
    <p> I am a student in natural resource management at Iowa State University. I work for both the <a id="firstLink"; href="https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/research/STRIPS/" title="STRIPS" color="green" target="blank">STRIPS</a> program and the <a id="GISF"; href="https://www.gis.iastate.edu/gisf" title="ISU GIS Facility" color="blue" target="blank">ISU GIS facility</a>. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in GIS and natural resources. I am passionate about conservation along with using GIS technology to further our management capabilites.</p>
    
    <p> I am currently working with folks in the GIS facility as well as poeple in CALS college to map ISU Research farms. This is exciting work because it will be used by educators and researchers while teaching future classes, or doing their own research. </p>
