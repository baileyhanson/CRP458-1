<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi Class, <br> My name is <b>Matt Theisen</b>. I am a fifth year senior studying Animal ecology with minors in forestry and GIS. I am on campus this semester and am also taking CRP 351. I have zero experience with coding, but I am looking to learn. I have taken a few GIS courses and worked in the LESEM lab on campus doing GIS work for a PhD student for the last year and a half. I have primarily digitized land use features on farms, while also running basic analysis on these land use polygons. I hope to learn a lot about the coding side of GIS and how to utilize more aspects of the software. .</p>
